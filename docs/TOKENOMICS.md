# 1000x Tokenomics

## 📊 Overview

The 1000x Token implements a deflationary economic model with a fixed initial supply and burn mechanics on every transfer. This document provides comprehensive analysis of the token's economic design, mathematical models, and long-term sustainability projections.

**Core Economic Principles:**
- **Deflationary by Design**: 10% of every transfer is permanently burned
- **Fixed Initial Supply**: 1000 tokens (1,000,000,000,000 base units with 9 decimals)
- **No Minting**: Supply can only decrease, never increase
- **Pure Burn Model**: 100% of fees burned, no treasury or rewards

---

## 🏗️ Supply Mechanics

### Initial Token Distribution

```
Initial Supply (S₀): 1,000 tokens
Decimals: 9
Base Units: 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion base units)
Network: Solana (Token-2022 Standard)
```

### Burn Mechanism

**Transfer Fee Structure:**
- **Fee Rate**: 10% (1,000 basis points)
- **Fee Collection**: Automatic via Token-2022 TransferFee extension
- **Fee Destination**: Burner authority (automated burning)
- **Burn Frequency**: Continuous (every 5 minutes via burner bot)

### Supply Formula

The total supply after `n` transfers follows an exponential decay model:

```
S(t) = S₀ × (0.9)ⁿ

Where:
- S(t) = Total supply after n transfers
- S₀ = Initial supply (1,000 tokens)
- n = Total number of transfers
- 0.9 = Retention rate (90% after 10% burn)
```

### Mathematical Relationships

#### 1. Supply Decay Function
```
S(n) = 1000 × (0.9)ⁿ
```

#### 2. Total Burned Supply
```
Burned(n) = S₀ - S(n) = 1000 × (1 - (0.9)ⁿ)
```

#### 3. Burn Rate Per Transfer
```
Burn_per_transfer = Transfer_amount × 0.1
```

#### 4. Effective Transfer Amount
```
Net_received = Transfer_amount × 0.9
```

#### 5. Supply Half-Life
The number of transfers required to halve the supply:
```
n₁/₂ = ln(0.5) / ln(0.9) ≈ 6.58 transfers
```

### Daily Burn Rate Projections

**Assumptions for Volume Modeling:**

```
Low Volume Scenario:  10 transfers/day
Med Volume Scenario:  50 transfers/day  
High Volume Scenario: 200 transfers/day
```

#### Low Volume (10 transfers/day)
```
Day 1:   Supply = 348.67 tokens  (65.1% burned)
Week 1:  Supply = 12.16 tokens   (98.8% burned)
Month 1: Supply = 0.000033 tokens (99.9997% burned)
```

#### Medium Volume (50 transfers/day)
```
Day 1:   Supply = 5.15 tokens    (99.5% burned)
Week 1:  Supply = 0.000003 tokens (99.9999% burned)
Month 1: Supply ≈ 0 tokens       (~100% burned)
```

#### High Volume (200 transfers/day)
```
Day 1:   Supply ≈ 0 tokens       (~100% burned)
Week 1:  Supply ≈ 0 tokens       (~100% burned)
Month 1: Supply ≈ 0 tokens       (~100% burned)
```

### Burn Rate Analysis

#### Cumulative Burn Percentage
```
f(n) = (1 - (0.9)ⁿ) × 100%

Key Milestones:
- 50% burned:  ~7 transfers
- 90% burned:  ~22 transfers  
- 99% burned:  ~44 transfers
- 99.9% burned: ~66 transfers
```

#### Daily Burn Velocity
```
Daily_burn_rate = 1 - (0.9)^(transfers_per_day)

Low Volume:   1 - (0.9)^10  = 65.13% per day
Med Volume:   1 - (0.9)^50  = 99.48% per day
High Volume:  1 - (0.9)^200 = 99.999996% per day
```

## 💰 Fee Distribution

### 100% Burn Model

**Fee Allocation:**
```
Transfer Fee: 10% of transfer amount
├── Treasury: 0%
├── Staking Rewards: 0%  
├── Development Fund: 0%
└── Burn: 100% ← All fees permanently destroyed
```

### Economic Impact of Pure Burn

#### 1. **Deflationary Pressure**
- Every transaction reduces total supply
- No dilution from rewards or treasury operations
- Increasing scarcity with usage

#### 2. **Value Accrual**
- All economic value flows to remaining token holders
- No yield farming or staking rewards needed
- Pure supply-demand dynamics

#### 3. **Network Effects**
- Higher usage = higher burn rate = increased scarcity
- Self-reinforcing deflationary cycle
- Incentivizes holding over frequent trading

### Burn Mechanics Implementation

#### Token-2022 Transfer Fee Extension
```rust
TransferFeeConfig {
    transfer_fee_basis_points: 1000,  // 10%
    maximum_fee: u64::MAX,           // No fee cap
    withdraw_withheld_authority: Some(burner_authority),
}
```

#### Automated Burning Process
1. **Fee Collection**: Token-2022 automatically withholds 10% of transfers
2. **Accumulation**: Fees accumulate in individual token accounts
3. **Withdrawal**: Burner bot withdraws withheld fees every 5 minutes
4. **Burning**: Withdrawn tokens permanently burned via Token-2022 burn instruction

#### Burn Verification
```bash
# Check current supply
solana-tokens supply $MINT_ADDRESS

# Verify burn transactions
solana transaction-history $BURNER_AUTHORITY --limit 10
```

## 🌊 Market Dynamics

### Wallet Cap Impact on Distribution

#### Current Wallet Limits
```
Wallet Cap: 5 tokens (0.5% of initial supply)
Dev Wallet: Unlimited (exempt from cap)
Total Addresses: Limited by 5-token distribution
```

#### Distribution Mechanics

**Maximum Theoretical Distribution:**
```
Max Wallets = Floor(Current_Supply / 5)

At Launch:     200 wallets (1000 ÷ 5)
After 10 xfers: 69 wallets (348.67 ÷ 5)  
After 20 xfers: 24 wallets (121.58 ÷ 5)
After 30 xfers: 9 wallets (42.66 ÷ 5)
```

#### Concentration Dynamics

**Gini Coefficient Projection:**
```
Initial Distribution (equal): Gini ≈ 0
With Wallet Caps: Gini ≤ 0.2 (relatively equal)
As Supply Shrinks: Gini → 0 (forced equality by caps)
```

**Key Insights:**
- Wallet caps prevent whale accumulation
- Shrinking supply forces more equal distribution
- Natural tendency toward democratization

### Liquidity Considerations

#### Liquidity Pool Dynamics

**AMM Pool Composition (Example: Raydium):**
```
Pool Structure: 1000X/SOL
Initial Liquidity: X tokens + Y SOL
Fee Impact: 10% burn on every trade through pool
```

**Pool Behavior Under Burn:**
- Pool token balance decreases with each trade
- Constant Product Formula: `x × y = k` (modified for burn)
- Effective Formula: `(x × 0.9) × y = k'` where `k' < k`

#### Price Impact Modeling

**Modified Constant Product with Burn:**
```
Standard AMM: Δy = (y × Δx) / (x + Δx)
With 10% Burn: Δy = (y × Δx × 0.9) / (x + Δx × 0.9)
```

**Price Impact Amplification:**
- Burn reduces pool depth faster than normal trading
- Higher slippage as pool becomes unbalanced
- Incentivizes arbitrage and liquidity provision

#### Liquidity Provider Economics

**LP Token Value:**
```
LP_value = sqrt(pool_x × pool_y)

Under burn mechanics:
- pool_x decreases with each trade
- LP token value depends on pool rebalancing
- Impermanent loss affected by burn rate
```

**LP Incentives:**
- High APY from trading fees (if volume exists)
- Risk of pool depletion from burn mechanics
- Potential for LP token value preservation vs token burn

### Market Cap and Valuation

#### Market Cap Evolution
```
Market_Cap = Current_Supply × Token_Price

As supply decreases:
- Fixed demand → Price increase
- Market cap may remain stable or increase
- Higher price per token despite lower supply
```

#### Velocity Impact

**Token Velocity Formula:**
```
Velocity = GDP / Money_Supply
V = (Transaction_Volume × Price) / Market_Cap
```

**Burn Impact on Velocity:**
- Transfer costs (10% burn) reduce velocity
- Higher holding incentives vs trading
- Potential for velocity equilibrium at sustainable level

---

## 📈 Economic Incentives Analysis

### Holding vs Trading Incentives

#### Holding Incentives
```
Holding Benefit = (Supply_Decrease / Time) × Token_Appreciation
```

**Factors favoring holding:**
- Guaranteed supply decrease from others' trading
- No dilution from minting
- Increasing scarcity value
- Avoiding 10% transaction cost

#### Trading Disincentives
```
Trading Cost = Transfer_Amount × 0.10
Opportunity Cost = Potential_Appreciation × Hold_Time
```

**Factors discouraging trading:**
- High transaction costs (10% burn)
- Loss of tokens on each trade
- Reducing personal stake in shrinking supply

### Game Theory Analysis

#### Prisoner's Dilemma Dynamics
```
Action Matrix (Two Players):
                Player B
               Hold | Trade
Player A Hold:  (High, High) | (Med, Low)
      Trade:   (Low, Med) | (Low, Low)
```

**Nash Equilibrium:** Both players hold (optimal outcome)

#### Network Effects
1. **Early Adoption**: High rewards for early holders as supply shrinks
2. **Critical Mass**: Sufficient holders needed for price stability  
3. **Utility Value**: Token must have use cases beyond speculation

### Long-term Sustainability Analysis

#### Supply Exhaustion Timeline

**Scenario Modeling:**
```
Conservative (10 transfers/day): ~30 days to <1% supply
Moderate (50 transfers/day): ~5 days to <1% supply  
Aggressive (200 transfers/day): ~1 day to <1% supply
```

#### Economic Sustainability Factors

**Positive Factors:**
- Decreasing supply increases value
- Strong holding incentives reduce velocity
- Simple, transparent mechanics
- No complex governance or inflation

**Risk Factors:**
- Potential supply exhaustion
- Reduced liquidity as supply shrinks
- Higher transaction costs may limit adoption
- Need for sustainable utility and demand

### Equilibrium Analysis

#### Sustainable Transaction Rate
```
Equilibrium occurs when:
Marginal_Utility(Trading) = Marginal_Cost(10% burn)
```

**Key Variables:**
- Token price appreciation rate
- Utility value of transfers
- Alternative transaction methods
- Market demand for scarce asset

#### Price Discovery Mechanism
```
Price = f(Utility_Value, Scarcity_Premium, Market_Sentiment)

Where:
- Utility_Value: Use case driven demand
- Scarcity_Premium: Supply reduction bonus
- Market_Sentiment: Speculative component
```
