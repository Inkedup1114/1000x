- Voting Threshold: 10% quorum, 66% approval
- Council: 7 elected representatives
- Voting Period: 7 days standard, 24 hours emergency
- Execution Delay: 48-72 hours
```

### **Phase 4: Immutability Consideration (Q3 2026+)**
**Decision Framework**: Community-driven evaluation
- Technical maturity assessment
- Governance maturity validation
- Market stability confirmation
- Community consensus requirement (75% approval, 25% quorum)

## 🔧 **Upgrade Process Framework**

### **Standard Upgrade Procedure**
1. **Proposal Phase**: Technical spec, security audit, impact assessment
2. **Development Phase**: Code implementation, testing, review
3. **Testing Requirements**: Unit, integration, property-based, security tests
4. **Staging Deployment**: Devnet testing and validation
5. **Production Deployment**: Mainnet upgrade with monitoring

### **Timelock Periods**
- **Minor Updates**: 24 hours
- **Feature Additions**: 48 hours  
- **Major Changes**: 72 hours
- **Governance Changes**: 168 hours (7 days)

### **Emergency Procedures**
**🔴 Level 1 (Critical Security)**:
- Active exploit in progress

- 2-of-5 multisig approval when available

**🟡 Level 2 (High Priority)**:
- Significant functionality bugs
- 6-hour expedited timeline
- 3-of-5 multisig approval required

## 🛠️ **Governance Tools Functionality**

### **Command-Line Management (`governance_tools.sh`)**
```bash
# Check current upgrade authority
./governance_tools.sh check-authority

# Rotate authority with new keypair generation
./governance_tools.sh rotate-authority --authority current-key.json

# Transfer authority to specific address (multisig/DAO)
./governance_tools.sh transfer-authority \
    --new-authority 2xF...Kx9 \
    --authority current-key.json

# Emergency authority transfer
./governance_tools.sh emergency-transfer \
    --authority current-key.json \
    --new-authority emergency-address

# Prepare multisig transition
./governance_tools.sh prepare-multisig

# Validate governance configuration
./governance_tools.sh validate-governance

# Make program immutable (IRREVERSIBLE)
./governance_tools.sh revoke-authority \
    --authority current-key.json
```

### **Safety Features**
