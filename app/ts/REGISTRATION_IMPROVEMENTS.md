# Hook Extra Account Metas Registration Improvements

## Overview
The `register_hook_extra_metas.ts` script has been enhanced with comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and verification features to ensure robust registration of extra account metas after program upgrades.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Retry Logic for Rate Limiting
- **Exponential backoff** with jitter to handle rate limiting gracefully
- **Configurable retry attempts** (default: 5 attempts)
- **Smart error detection** for rate limit (429) and "Too Many Requests" errors
- **Progressive delay increases** to avoid overwhelming the RPC endpoint

```typescript
const CONFIG: Config = {
  maxRetries: 5,
  retryDelayMs: 2000,
  confirmationTimeout: 60000,
  verificationAttempts: 3,
};
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Program Deployment Verification
- **Pre-flight checks** to ensure the program is deployed and executable
- **Account existence validation** before attempting registration
- **Executable status verification** to confirm the program can be invoked
- **Detailed logging** of program information for debugging

```typescript
async function verifyProgramDeployment(connection: Connection, programId: PublicKey)
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Custom error classes** for different failure scenarios:
  - `ProgramNotDeployedError`: Program not found or not executable
  - `RateLimitError`: Rate limiting detected
  - `SpaceAllocationError`: Issues with account space allocation
- **Specific error messages** with actionable guidance
- **Graceful degradation** for recoverable errors

### 4. ‚úÖ Successful Registration Logging
- **Transaction signature logging** with Solana Explorer links
- **PDA address confirmation** for verification
- **Account details display** (size, owner, lamports)
- **Structured console output** with emojis for better readability

### 5. ‚úÖ Registration Verification
- **Post-registration validation** by reading back account data
- **Owner verification** to ensure the hook program owns the account
- **Data integrity checks** to confirm the account was properly initialized
- **Multiple verification attempts** with retry logic

```typescript
async function verifyRegistration(
  connection: Connection,
  extraAccountMetaListPda: PublicKey,
  hookProgramId: PublicKey
)
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites
1. **Program must be deployed first** using the deployment script
2. **Environment variables** must be configured in `app/ts/.env`
3. **Sufficient SOL balance** for transaction fees and rent exemption

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy from example and configure
cp app/ts/.env.example app/ts/.env

# Required variables:
PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_private_key_here
RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
PROGRAM_ID=HU8xgmKfWv16e77BX6DEDBCXv8wmdxhYH5TPTSEGu4E2
MINT_ADDRESS=EYfH82983Mq85apeFGnz4wH4Xaexjun5MToNQfYevKic
DEV_WALLET=your_dev_wallet_pubkey
```

### Run Registration
```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
pnpm hook:register

# Or directly with ts-node
ts-node app/ts/register_hook_extra_metas.ts
```

## Error Scenarios and Handling

### Program Not Deployed
```
‚ùå Registration failed:
   Program HU8xgmKfWv16e77BX6DEDBCXv8wmdxhYH5TPTSEGu4E2 is not deployed or not executable
   Please deploy the program first using the deployment script.
```

### Rate Limiting
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limited on attempt 2, waiting 4532ms...
üîÑ Attempt 3/5 for extra account metas registration
```

### Space Allocation Issues
```
‚ùå Registration failed:
   Space allocation error: Insufficient funds for account creation. Please ensure the payer has enough SOL for rent exemption.
   Please check account funding and space calculations.
```

### Successful Registration
```
‚úÖ Extra account metas registered successfully!

## Configuration Options

The script can be customized by modifying the `CONFIG` object:

```typescript
const CONFIG: Config = {
  maxRetries: 5,           // Number of retry attempts
  retryDelayMs: 2000,      // Base delay between retries (exponential backoff)
  confirmationTimeout: 60000, // Transaction confirmation timeout
  verificationAttempts: 3,    // Number of verification attempts
};
```

## Dependencies
- `@coral-xyz/anchor`: Anchor framework integration
- `@solana/web3.js`: Solana web3 client
- `dotenv`: Environment variable management
- `bs58`: Base58 encoding/decoding

## Integration with Deployment Pipeline
This script is designed to work seamlessly with the program deployment pipeline:

1. **Deploy program** using `scripts/deploy_program_upgrade.sh`
2. **Verify deployment** (automatic in script)
3. **Register extra metas** using this enhanced script
4. **Verify registration** (automatic in script)

The script automatically detects if the program has been upgraded and handles the registration accordingly.
