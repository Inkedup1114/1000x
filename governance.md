# 1000x Hook Governance Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the governance mechanism for the 1000x transfer hook program, specifically focusing on the wallet cap management system. The governance system balances security, decentralization, and operational flexibility.

## Governance Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Governance Authority**: A designated public key with authority to propose changes
2. **Timelock Mechanism**: 48-hour delay between proposal and execution
3. **Event Emission**: All governance actions emit events for transparency
4. **Parameter Validation**: Automated checks ensure proposed changes are reasonable

### Wallet Cap Governance

#### Current State
- **Fixed Cap**: 5,000,000,000 units (5 tokens with 9 decimals)
- **Percentage of Supply**: 0.5% of 1000 token total supply
- **Dev Wallet Exemption**: Development wallet is exempt from cap restrictions

#### Governance Decision: Mutable Cap with Timelock

**Rationale for Mutability:**
- **Market Adaptability**: Token economics may evolve requiring cap adjustments
- **Emergency Response**: Ability to respond to unforeseen circumstances
- **Community Governance**: Enables community-driven parameter optimization
- **Progressive Decentralization**: Allows gradual transition to full DAO governance

**Security Measures:**
- **48-Hour Timelock**: Prevents rapid, potentially malicious changes
- **Range Validation**: New caps must be > 0 and ≤ 100 tokens (10% of supply)
- **Event Transparency**: All proposals, executions, and cancellations are logged
- **Single Authority**: Clear responsibility chain prevents governance conflicts

## Governance Processes

### 1. Wallet Cap Update Process

#### Step 1: Proposal
```
propose_wallet_cap_update(new_cap: u64)
```
- **Authority Required**: Governance authority signature
- **Validation**: 0 < new_cap ≤ 100_000_000_000 (100 tokens)
- **Timelock**: 48 hours from proposal
- **Event**: `WalletCapUpdateProposed`

#### Step 2: Execution (After Timelock)
```
execute_wallet_cap_update()
```
- **Timing**: Must wait 48 hours after proposal
- **Authority Required**: Governance authority signature
- **Effect**: Updates `wallet_cap_raw` in HookConfig
- **Event**: `WalletCapUpdated`

#### Step 3: Cancellation (Optional)
```
cancel_wallet_cap_update()
```
- **Timing**: Can be called anytime before execution
- **Authority Required**: Governance authority signature
- **Effect**: Removes pending update
- **Event**: `WalletCapUpdateCanceled`

### 2. Governance Authority Transfer

```
update_governance_authority(new_governance_authority: Pubkey)
```
- **Authority Required**: Current governance authority signature
- **Effect**: Immediately transfers governance rights
- **Event**: `GovernanceAuthorityUpdated`

## Risk Assessment

### Fixed Cap Risks
- **Inflexibility**: Cannot adapt to market conditions
- **Obsolescence**: May become inappropriate over time
- **Emergency Response**: No mechanism for crisis management

### Mutable Cap Risks
- **Governance Attack**: Malicious authority could harm token economics
- **Centralization**: Single point of failure in governance
- **Front-running**: Advance knowledge of cap changes could be exploited

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Technical Mitigations
1. **Timelock Delay**: 48-hour window allows community response
2. **Range Limits**: Caps bounded between 0 and 100 tokens
3. **Event Logging**: Full transparency of all governance actions
4. **Authority Constraints**: Only governance authority can make changes

#### Operational Mitigations
1. **Multi-Sig Governance**: Recommended governance authority implementation
2. **Community Monitoring**: Public events enable community oversight
3. **Emergency Procedures**: Clear escalation paths for governance issues
4. **Regular Reviews**: Periodic assessment of governance parameters

## Implementation Details

### Smart Contract Architecture

```rust
pub struct HookConfig {
    pub dev_wallet: Pubkey,           // Development wallet (cap exempt)
    pub wallet_cap_raw: u64,          // Current wallet cap
    pub governance_authority: Pubkey,  // Governance authority
    pub pending_cap_update: Option<PendingCapUpdate>, // Pending changes
}

pub struct PendingCapUpdate {
    pub new_cap: u64,        // Proposed new cap
    pub proposed_at: i64,    // Proposal timestamp
    pub execution_time: i64, // When update can be executed
}
```

### Events

All governance actions emit events for transparency:

- `WalletCapUpdateProposed`: New cap proposed
- `WalletCapUpdated`: Cap successfully changed
- `WalletCapUpdateCanceled`: Pending update canceled
- `GovernanceAuthorityUpdated`: Governance authority changed

### Validation Rules

1. **Cap Range**: 0 < new_cap ≤ 100_000_000_000 units
2. **Timelock**: 48 hours minimum between proposal and execution
3. **Authority**: Only governance authority can propose/execute changes
4. **Single Pending**: Only one pending update at a time

## Future Considerations

### DAO Migration Path

The current single-authority model can evolve toward full DAO governance:

1. **Phase 1**: Multi-signature governance authority
2. **Phase 2**: Governance token-based voting
3. **Phase 3**: Full on-chain DAO with complex proposal mechanisms

### Parameter Evolution

Additional governable parameters could include:

- **Timelock Duration**: Currently fixed at 48 hours
- **Cap Bounds**: Currently 0 to 100 tokens
- **Dev Wallet**: Currently immutable
- **Hook Activation**: Enable/disable hook functionality

### Emergency Mechanisms

Future versions could include:

- **Emergency Pause**: Ability to pause transfers
- **Emergency Cap**: Temporary cap reductions
- **Guardian Role**: Time-bounded emergency authority

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Recommended Monitoring

1. **Event Watching**: Monitor all governance events
2. **Parameter Tracking**: Track cap changes over time
3. **Authority Monitoring**: Watch for governance key changes
4. **Timelock Tracking**: Monitor pending proposals

### Alert Conditions

- New cap proposals
- Cap updates executed
- Governance authority changes
- Failed governance transactions

## Conclusion

The 1000x hook implements a balanced governance approach that:

- **Enables Adaptation**: Mutable caps allow market responsiveness
- **Ensures Security**: Timelock and validation prevent abuse
- **Maintains Transparency**: Event emission provides full visibility
- **Supports Evolution**: Architecture enables future DAO migration

This design prioritizes security while maintaining the flexibility needed for a dynamic DeFi ecosystem. The 48-hour timelock provides sufficient time for community review while preventing unnecessary delays in legitimate governance actions.
